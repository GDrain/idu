## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 16.04  
- Python 3.6.8   
- CUDA 10.0  
- cuDNN 7.5

### Requirements
- tensorflow==1.13.1  
- scipy==1.3.0  

## Training
The code for training is not included in this repository, and we cannot release the full training code for

### Trained Models
Download trained models on [THUMOS-14](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=8b-Z&id=1DUpOzbLG-8ptpPVJrzsRiKFRIaO1FBcs) and [TVSeries](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=A33G&id=1zJ7EfhQg91XVrV9ryjvmcoyQDEl3U_Fn) in 'dataset name'/logs/'.

## Testing

__For THUMOS-14__  
```
python thumos14/test_tfn.py --model_name TFN-ED
```
The code provides the results of TFN-ED, '__mAP of 55.7%__'.  
An AP value for each class are also provided, as reported in our supplementary material.

__For TVSeries__  
```
python tvseries/test_tfn.py --model_name TFN-ED
```
The code provides the results of TFN-ED, '__mcAP of 85.0%__'.  
A cAP value for each class are also provided, as reported in our supplementary material.
