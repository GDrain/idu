This is official implementation of IDU. We investigate on the question of ***how RNNs can learn to explicitly discriminate relevant information from irrelevant information for detecting actions in the present***. To this end, we propose a novel recurrent unit that
extends GRU with a mechanism utilizing current information and an early embedding module. We perform extensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets, where our IDN achieves stateof-the-art performances of 86.1% mcAP and 60.3% mAP on TVSeries and THUMOS-14, respectively.

## Updates
**30 May, 2020**: Initial update

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 16.04  
- Python 3.6.8   
- CUDA 10.0  
- cuDNN 7.5

### Requirements
- tensorflow==1.13.1  
- scipy==1.3.0  

### Patches

## Training
The code for training is not included in this repository, and we cannot release the full training code for

### Datasets
Download our extracted features on RGB and Flow.

### Trained Models
Download trained models on [THUMOS-14](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=8b-Z&id=1DUpOzbLG-8ptpPVJrzsRiKFRIaO1FBcs) and [TVSeries](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=A33G&id=1zJ7EfhQg91XVrV9ryjvmcoyQDEl3U_Fn) in 'dataset name'/logs/'.

## Testing

__For THUMOS-14__  
```
python thumos14/test_idu.py --model_name TFN-ED
```
The code provides the results of our IDN, '__mAP of 55.7%__'.  

__For TVSeries__  
```
python tvseries/test_idu.py --model_name TFN-ED
```
The code provides the results of our IDN, '__mcAP of 85.0%__'.
